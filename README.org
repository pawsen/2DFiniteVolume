* 2D Finite Volume Method for Transport of Thermal Energy in Cavity Flow
** Intro
In this project the transport equation for a scalar quantity in a fluid flow is solved on a uniform grid.
In the problem cases this scalar quantity is the dimensionless temperature. Therefore the problem only depends upon the PeclÃ©t number, Pe which is a ratio betweem convection and diffusion.
The fluxes used in the finite volume scheme are approximated by finite differences: 
For the diffusion part of the equation, the central difference scheme, CDS are always applied since diffusion acts in all directions independent of the flow.   
For the convective part, either CDS or upwind difference scheme, UDS is applied. UDS only used infomation from the upstream direction.
CDS is second order, whereas UDS only is first-order.
Combining CDS-CDS results in oscillations and divergence on coarser grids (Pe*dx>2), but gives a more accurate solution than CDS-UDS. The CDS-UDS scheme always result in a diagonal-dominant system matrix, which should be the case the numerical method should mimic the physics.
CDS-UDS should not be used since it lowers the order of this FVM, which is second-order.
